看完印度电影《摔跤吧，爸爸》之后，我有个问题要问：“现在印度还是女孩出生后就不管她，让她操持家务吗？”我倒希望不是。现在的我也是女孩，我不用干家务，都是爷爷奶奶干，我如果生在了那个时候，被父母不管，肯定很凄惨。

我看到了吉塔和巴比塔被迫跑步时，我觉得她们的父亲真是太可恶了，当我看到结尾时，我感受到了父亲的伟大和父爱。

我看到吉塔战斗，一个女孩，打了平手，投硬币时，我的心提到了嗓子眼，我希望吉塔能够赢。

我看到那个女孩将要出嫁，她说父母不理她时，我替她悲伤，我也感受到了被父母抛弃不理的滋味。

我感觉这部电影很好看，我很佩服吉塔，我替吉塔感到骄傲，因为她改变了印度，是印度的第一位能够上奥运会的女子。

### How to Find and Organize Papers
In this stage I work with two softwares: [EndNote](http://endnote.com/) and [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/). The typical working procedure is depicted as:   
**Step1.** Search for published papers on interested topics in [Web of Science](https://webofknowledge.com/). *DO NOT* forget to save your search history and have a monthly-summary of the searched topics if you wanna catch up with the latest news.   
**Step2.** Export the searched results into EndNote, thus you can glimpse, keyword and note these papers anytime you like. In this step, paper will be filtered by its title, abstract, authors and publication journals. Some papers are worthy reading further, but most of them will be marked as *useless* and neglected forever.   
**Step3.** For papers that need further attention, I will copy them to Zotero, keep an detailed bibliography with electronic PDF attached. Then Why Zotero is used in this step instead of EndNote? There are following reasons:

1. There are tooooooo many papers in EndNote after **Step2**, hard to locate these valuable ones. So EndNote is only used for first-step filtration.
2. Zotero has a more *easy-to-use* keyword marking system, and its interface is more compact.
3. And most most important, I met Zotero *before* Endnote. As you can guess, I am used to Zotero.   

After the above three steps, there ain't that many papers left. What you have to do now is rather simple yet very time and brain consuming - READ THEM. This introduces next topic - How to read papers?

### How to Read Papers

In this stage I work with two softwares: [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), [MindManager](https://www.mindjet.com/mindmanager/), [PDF-XChange Editor](http://www.tracker-software.com/product/pdf-xchange-editor) and [Sumatra PDF](http://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader.html). 
I prefer to take notes directly on the pdf. PDF-XChange Editor is enough for make notations, Sumatra PDF can open the same file while I am reading in PDF-XChange Editor. Whenever I read something interesting or worthy, I will excerpt it into the mindmanager, or Zotero notes.
